DESIGN:

The core functionality of the driver is now in place.

Thumbnails from the film strip can be made. A single thumbnail can 
be selected and a 1494 x 1494 scan (preview) made.

The GUI now consists of three thumbnail panels, a panel for the preview, 
a log window and buttons to activate the scanning. For the moment the 
contrast functionality is separated from the scanning functionality.


PREREQUESTS:

A FH-869S Brownie Strip Film holder. A filmstrip of three 6x6 color 
positive images.

lsscsi must be installed (sudo apt install lsscsi).
convert must be installed (sudo apt install imagemagick-6.q16).
 

DEVELOPMENT:

The ability to scale down a BufferedImage. Modifications to the Split 
logic. The ability to select only one thumb at a time and draw a 
selection indicator. The ability to send the selected offset to a 
C program (preview.c) that does the scanning. The offset is multiplied by 
the ratio of the full resolution to the the thumbnail resolution, that is 
4000 / 83 = 48. unitready.c is used to spin for scanner ready status.


TODO:

The next main task is to implement full 8964 x 8964 scanning. The GUI 
must be expanded to hold the generated image in a window and you must
be able to save the content of this window as a TIFF file.

3-line scanning must be implemented. More checks that values and offsets 
are legal and within bounds.
